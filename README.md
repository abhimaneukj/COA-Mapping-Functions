# COA-Mapping-Functions
The project on Mapping functions in Computer Organization and Architecture is implemented using Python programming language. The mapping functions are used to map a particular block of main memory to a particular block of cache. Python is a general purpose and high level programming language. The simple syntax rules of the programming language further makes it easier for you to keep the code base readable and application maintainable.

The major functions include
	DIRECT ( )
	ASSOCIATIVE ( )
	SET_ASSOCIATIVE ( )

The program is implemented in a menu driven format where user can choose the three mapping techniques. The user has the ability to change and modify the mapping techniques without running the program again. This is done by implementing while loop. The program also uses different python modules for implementing different mapping techniques.

The modules include
	Math module
	Random module
